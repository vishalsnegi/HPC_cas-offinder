# HPC_cas-offinder

This repository will help the user perform CRISPR/cas9 off-target sites (in any given genomes) on hpc cluster 

CRISPR/cas9 off-target sites in given genomes This repository comprises shell script, input file, and some example genomes that can be used for determining CRISPR/Cas9 off-target sites in any given genome(s) using the Cas-OFFinder (http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/).

The online server of Cas-OFFinder has a limited number of genomes to search from. With the given script, one can use any custom genome.

The detailed information regarding Cas-OFFinder can be found in the following article: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/10/1473/267560
